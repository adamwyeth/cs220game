1. The names of all the team members
 
2. Iteration 1 plan:
- Which use cases you plan to implement in the 1st iteration (10/30-11/12)
- How you plan to divide the work between the 3 or 4 pairs of students in your team

Note that there are different ways to divide the work. You could divide based on use cases, or use case steps, or classes, or high-level components (e.g., GUI vs others), etc. Please be specific.
 
3. Brief Iteration 2 plan
- Which use cases you plan to implement in the 2nd iteration (11/13-11/26)
 
4. A brief design for iteration 1
- If you will use object-oriented programming, please provide a brief class diagram for the main classes you will implement for iteration 1. You don't need to include all the details in your diagram ---- for example, getter and setter functions don't need to be specified. Key operations and attributes need to be specified.
 
5. How do you plan to coordinate with each other?
Have you set up a code repository? You are welcome to use the phoenix-forge repository.
Have you set up a plan for all team members to periodically get together?
