3. A brief overview of what you are proposing (be brief here) 

We would like to create a 2D videogame for PC. From a high-level standpoint, we would like to include basic functionalities like saving a game, loading a game, and deleting/copying save game states, which will all be stored locally on the player's computer. The game will be a platformer set in an elementary schooler's nightmares, with each "nightmare" being a level. The player must progress through the nightmares by overcoming barriers such as defeating or escaping from enemies and solving puzzle-type minigames aided by a series of items and skills that the player can acquire throughout the game.

X4. A complete use-case diagram of the proposed project
